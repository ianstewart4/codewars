// My solution. Still recovering so keeping it easy with a 7kyu
// Instructions: Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

function even_or_odd(number) {
    return number % 2 ? 'Odd' : 'Even' // == 0 which is falsy 
}

// same as best solution :)
